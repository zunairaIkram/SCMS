# SCMS
Swim Club Management System, A rational DBMS using python's Faker package and SQL

SCMS is a small scale management system for a swim club. The system utilizes a rational Database Management System (DBMS) implemented using Python's Faker package for generating sample data and SQL for database operations.

## Getting Started
To set up and run SCMS, follow these steps:

1. **Open SQL Compiler**: You need a SQL compiler installed on your system, such as Microsoft SQL Server. Open the SQL compiler and copy the provided SQL code.

2. **Create Database**: Run the SQL code to create the database. Select and execute the "create database" line to initialize the database.

3. **Python Code**: Open the Python code in any Python compiler. Ensure that the connection to the database is established successfully after running the Python code file.

4. **Table Data Insertion**: Run the Python code for the specific table file where you want to insert data.

5. **Data Verification**: After inserting data into the tables, run the `select * from` SQL query on the respective table to verify that the data has been successfully inserted.

6. **Testing**: Test the functionality of the system by generating reports and analyzing the output.

## Project Structure
- **Database Files**: Contains SQL scripts to create the database schema.
- **Python Files**: Includes Python scripts for establishing database connections, generating sample data, and performing database operations.
- **Reports**: Generated reports showcasing various aspects of swim club management.

## Dependencies
- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. And you can use a compiler like VS code.
- **SQL Compiler**: Utilize a SQL compiler like Microsoft SQL Server.
